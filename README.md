# Skutek: extensible effects without (heavy) lifting

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcinzh/skutek.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marcinzh/skutek)

Skutek ([pronounced](https://translate.google.com/#pl/en/skutek): *skoo-tech*) is a framework implementing a monad of extensible effects 
(a.k.a. [*One monad to rule them all*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGJLeHhsZBo)), based on [Freer monad](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf), adapted to leverage specifics of Scala's type system, with main differences being:

- Use of intersection types in lieu of union types (which Scala doesn't have), to model sets of effects.

- Use of classic OOP inheritence as the way of extending the monad with new operations.


# Example
```scala
import skutek._

object Main extends App {

  val eff = for {
    a <- Get[Int]
    b <- Ask[Int]
    c <- if (b != 0) Return(a / b) else Wrong(s"Tried to divide $a by zero")
    _ <- Put(c)
  } yield ()

  val handler = ErrorHandler[String] +! StateHandler(100).exec +! ReaderHandler(3)

  val result = handler.run(eff)

  println(result) // prints "Right(33)"
}
```

# Setup

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo

libraryDependencies += "com.github.marcinzh" %% "skutek-core" % "0.4.0"
```

# Features

- Simplicity of use:
    - No need of defining the effect stack upfront. 
    - No need of lifting of operations into the monad.
    - Effect subtyping.
    
- Simplicity of implementation:
    - No dependencies on external libraries.
    - No clever type-fu, no macros. Mostly immutable OOP style.
     
- Practical stuff:
    - Predefined set of basic effects (`Reader`, `Writer`, etc.).
    - Ability to annotate effects with tags
    - Potentially parallel execution of effects.
    - Support for `for` comprehension guards, for effects compatible with filtering (e.g. `Maybe`, `Choice`).
    - Tested stack safety.    
    
- Caveats and limitations:
    - General infancy of the project.
    - No possiblity of adapting pre-existing monads as Skutek's effects.
    - Removing effects from the stack (local handling) isn't as easy as adding them. Some explicit typing is necessary.
    - Rare occurences of false positives by Scala's linter (i.e. "inferred `Any`...")
    - Using patterns in `for` comprehensions can trigger surprising errors (Scala's wart, not specific to Skutek)
    - **Type unsafety:** Certain class of invalid effect stacks are detected **at runtime** only. 
    - Lack of performance analysis.
    - `Concurrency` effect is a hack.

# Core concepts in Skutek

1. **Effect Definition**
1. **Effect**
1. **Effect Stack**
1. **Computation**
1. **Operation**
1. **Handler**
1. **Handling Effects**

# 1\. Effect Definition

*Effect Definition*, is a fragment of program, that extends functionality of `Effectful` monad. The monad, which is all that Skutek is about.

An *Effect Definition* contains definitions of 3 kinds of entities:
* An *Effect*.
* *Operation(s)* of that *Effect*.
* *Handler(s)* of that *Effect*.

Skutek comes with [predefined](#predefined-effects) effects. User can [define new effects](#defining-your-own-effect) as well.


# 2\. Effect

In Skutek, an *Effect* is an **abstract type** (a trait), serving as a unique, type-level name. Such type is supposed to be never instantiated or inherited. *Effects* are only useful as type-arguments for other types or methods. Most notably, for types of *Computations* and *Handler* constructors.

*Effects* can be:
* parameterless, e.g. `Maybe`, `Choice`
* or parametrized, e.g. `State[Int]`, `Error[String]`

# 3\. Effect Stack

An *Effect Stack* in Skutek, is a set of *Effects*.  

It's a misnomer to call it a "stack", as it wrongfully (in Skutek) suggests significance of the order of elements. We're going to use this term anyway, for traditon and convenience.

Skutek uses **intersection types** as the representation of *Effect Stacks*.

For example:
```scala
State[Double] with Error[String] with Choice
```
represents 3-element *Effect Stack*, comprising 3 *Effects*:
```scala
State[Double] 
Error[String] 
Choice
```

The nature of intersection types gives raise to the following properties of *Effect Stacks*:

1. An *Effect* is also a single element *Effect Stack*.

1. Type `Any` represents **empty** *Effect Stack*.

   This might be counterintuitive. Had Scala have union types, we could have used them for *Effect Stacks* instead. Empty *Effect Stack* would have been `Nothing` type. The `Effectful` trait would have to have flipped the variance direction on its [second type parameter](#4-computation). Those two representations (tha actual and the hypothetical) are dual of each other, and would have similar properties. 

1. Type `Any` is the neutral element of type intersection operator. In Scala, the following types are equivalent:
    ```scala
    State[Int]
    State[Int] with Any
    Any with State[Int]
    ```
    Therefore, they all represent the same *Effect Stack*.

1. The order of occurence of *Effects* in the *Effect Stack* doesn't matter. In Scala, the following types are equivalent:
    ```scala
    State[Int] with Maybe
    Maybe with State[Int]
    ```
    Therefore, they all represent the same *Effect stack*.

1. Multiple occurences of the same *Effect* in the *Effect Stack*, are equivalent to just one occurence. In Scala, the following types are equivalent:
    ```scala
    State[Int]
    State[Int] with State[Int]
    ```
    Therefore, they all represent the same *Effect Stack*.

1. Bigger *Effect Stack* is a subtype of a smaller *Effect Stack*. For example:
    ```scala
    State[Int] with Maybe <: State[Int]
    State[Int] with Maybe <: Maybe
    ```
    This will have consequences for types of *Computations* and *Handlers* (effect subtyping).

There are caveats related to intersection types:
* A curious reader may wonder, what happens if there are two occurences of the same, parametrised *Effect* in the *Effect Stack*, but each one is applied with different type-argument. For example:
  ```scala
  State[Int] with State[String]
  ```
  It will be discussed in [Tag Conflicts](#tag-conflicts) section.

* Redundancies and reorderings shown in points 3, 4 and 5, may appear in error messages, when the *Effect Stack* of a *Computation* is inferred by Scala's compiler. It's ugly, but normal.

* Occasionally, when using empty *Effect Stacks*, Scala compiler's linter may complain with message:
  ```
  a type was inferred to be `Any`, which usually indicates programming error
  ```
  This is a false positive. The solution is to either:
  - Add explicit types here and there, until the linter shuts up.
  - Selectively disable this specific feature of linter (and if it works for you, let me know).
  - Disable the linter entirely.
  

# 4\. Computation

A *Computation* is value of a type derived from `Effectful[+A, -U]` trait.  
Parameter `A` is the result type of the *Computation*.  
Parameter `U` is the *Effect Stack* of the *Computation*.

Example:
```scala
type MyComputation = Effectful[Foo, State[Double] with Error[String] with Choice]
```
Same example, but using `!!`, an infix type alias for `Effectful`:
```scala
type MyComputation = Foo !! State[Double] with Error[String] with Choice
```

The latter is more readable, as long as you remember that:
* Precedence of `!!` is lower than of `with`, so `A !! U with V` means `A !! (U with V)`
* Precedence of `!!` is higher than of `=>`, so `A => B !! U` means `A => (B !! U)`

### 4\.1\. Return
The simplest *Computation* is constructed by `Return(x)` case class, where `x` is any value.  

`Return(_)` is similar to `Pure(_)`, `Some(_)`, `Right(_)`, `Success(_)` from other monads. Except in Skutek, `Return(_)` is shared for all possible *Effects*.

A `Return(x)` has empty *Effect Stack*:
```scala
// assuming: 
val a: A = ???

// let:
val eff = Return(a)

// we get:
eff: A !! Any
```

Also, `Return()` is an abbreviation of `Return(())`.

### 4\.2\. Composing Computations

*Computation* is a monad, so standard `map`, `flatMap` and `flatten` methods are available.

When 2 *Computations* are composed using `flatMap`, their *Effect Stacks* are automatically merged, by type intersection:
```scala
// assuming:
val eff1: A !! U1 = ???
val eff2: B !! U2 = ???

// let:
val eff3 = eff1.flatMap(_ => eff2)

// we get:
eff3: B !! U1 with U2 
```

*Computations* can also be composed parallely, using product operator: `*!`

The parallellism is potential only: it may or may not be actually happening, depending on *Handler* used to execute the *Computation*.

Just like in case of `flatMap`, the *Effect Stack* of product equals *Effect Stack* is are automatically merged, by type intersection:

TBD.

# 5\. Operation


An *Operation* is an elementary *Computation*, specific for an *Effect*.  
*Operations* are defined as dumb case classes, indirectly inheriting from `Effectful` trait.

Examples:

|Constructor of *Operation* | It's *Effect Stack* | Type of the *Computation*|
|---|---|---|
|`Get[Double]`        |`State[Double]`   | `Double !! State[Double]`| 
|`Put(1.337)`         | same as above    | `Unit !! State[Double]`| 
|`Tell("Hello")`      |`Writer[String]`  | `Unit !! Writer[String]`|
|`Choose(1 to 10)`    |`Choice`          | `Int !! Choice`|

Nullary *Operations* require explicit type parameter, like in the case of `Get[Double]`.

# 6\. Handler

*Handler* is an object, that has ability to handle an *Effect* (or multiple *Effects*).

Trait `Handler` is the supertype of all *Handlers*. It's dependent on 2 member types:
* `Handler#Effects` - The set of *Effects* that can be handled by the *Handler* (an *Effect Stack*, essentially)
* `Handler#Result[X]` - A type-level function, describing how *Computation's* result type is transformed during handling the *Effect Stack*.

There are 2 kinds of *Handlers*:

## 6\.1\. Elementary handlers

Those are the original *Handlers*, each one dedicated to handling **single** specific *Effect*. Examples:

| Constructor of *Handler* | `Handler#Effects` | `Handler#Result[A]` |
|---|---|---|
|`StateHandler(42.0)`|`State[Double]`| `(A, Double)` |
|`ErrorHandler[String]`|`Error[String]`|`Either[String, A]`|
|`ChoiceHandler`|`Choice`|`Vector[A]`|

## 6\.2\. Composed handlers
Multiple *Handlers* can be associatively composed using `+!` operator, forming *Handler*
that can handle bigger *Effect Stack*. 

For example, *Handler*:
```scala
val handler = StateHandler(42.0) +! ErrorHandler[String] +! ChoiceHandler
```
Can handle the following *Effects Stack*:

```scala
State[Double] with Error[String] with Choice
```

The order of composition matters.  
The order of occurence of the operands is: outermost effect first, the innermost effect last.  
However, the order of actual handling is **reverse** of that: the innermost effect is handled first, the outermost effect is handled last.


## 7\. Handling Effects

Handling an *Effect Stack*, is an act of using a *Handler* to transform a *Computation* to another one. 
During this transformation, following things are observed:
* *Computation's* *Effect Stack* is reduced.  
  Precisely, a set difference is being performed: from *Computation's* *Effect Stack*, the *Handler's* *Effect Stack* is subtracted. Possibly, leaving empty set in the outcome.
* *Computation's* result type is transformed by `Handler#Result[_]` type-level function.

After all *Effects* are handled, *Computation's* *Effect Stack* is empty (i.e. provable to be `=:= Any`).
Then, the *Computation* is ready to be executed. The obtained value is finally liberated from the monadic context:
```scala
// assuming:
eff: A !! Any

// let:
val a = eff.run   

// we get:
a: A
```
## 7\.1\. Full handling

The **easiest** way of using *Handlers*, is to handle entire *Effect Stack* at once: 
1. Create composed *Handler*, covering all *Effects* in the *Computation's* *Effect Stack*.
2. Handle the *Effects* and execute the *Computation*, all in one call.

Example:
```scala
// assuming:
eff: Int !! State[Double] with Choice = ???

// Step 1.
val handler = StateHandler(1.377) +! ChoiceHandler

// Step 2.
val result = handler.run(eff) 

val result = eff.runWith(handler)   // alternative syntax, with eff and handler flipped

// we get:
result: (Vector[Int], Double)
```

## 7\.2\. Local handling
In practical programs, it's often desirable to handle only a subset of
*Computation's* *Effect Stack*, leaving the rest to be handled elsewhere.
This allows to encapsulate usage of local *Effect(s)* in a module, while 
still exporting effectful API that uses other, public *Effect(s)*.

Such situation (although on small scale) can be seen in the [Queens](./examples/src/main/scala/skutek_examples/Queens.scala) example:
* The `State` *Effect* is used and [handled](./examples/src/main/scala/skutek_examples/Queens.scala#L39) internally.
* The `Choice` *Effect* is used and [exported](./examples/src/main/scala/skutek_examples/Queens.scala#L28) in function's result.
* The `Choice` *Effect* is finally [handled](./examples/src/main/scala/skutek_examples/Queens.scala#L10) by the client. By having control of the *Handler*, the client can decide whether it wants to enumerate all solutions, or just get the first one that is found.

There are 2 ways of handling *Effects* locally: one is simpler, the other is safer. The safety issue is explained in the [Tag Conflicts](./README.md#tag-conflicts) section.

There is another complication. Unfortunately, in both cases you won't be able to rely on type inference. It will be necessery to explicitly pass an *Effect Stack* as type parameter to handling methods. 

Moreover, this explicit *Effect Stack* has to consist of *Effects* that are going to **remain unhandled**, not the ones that are being **handled** in the call. That's rather inconvenient, but we can do nothing about it.

### 7\.2\.1\. The simpler way

```scala
// assuming:
val eff: Int !! State[Double] with Reader[Boolean] with Error[String] with Choice = ???
// continued...
```
We are going to handle *Effects* `State[Double]` and `Choice`.  
We are going to leave *Effects* `Reader[Boolean]` and `Error[String]` unhandled.

```scala
// ...continued
// let:
val handler = StateHandler(1.377) +! ChoiceHandler

val eff2 = handler.handleCarefully[Reader[Boolean] with Error[String]](eff) 

val eff2 = eff.handleCarefullyWith[Reader[Boolean] with Error[String]](handler)  // alternative syntax

// we get:
eff2: (Vector[Int], Double) !! Reader[Boolean] with Error[String]
```

### 7\.2\.2\. The safer way

```scala
// assuming:
val eff = ... // same as in previous example 

// let:
val hander = // same as in previous example 

val eff2 = handler.fx[Error[String]].fx[Reader[Boolean]].handle(eff) 

val eff2 = eff.fx[Error[String]].fx[Reader[Boolean]].handleWith(handler)  // alternative syntax

// we get:
eff2: ... // same as in previous example
```
The `fx` method is defined for both `Effectful` and `Handler` traits. 

The chain of `fx` method calls is a Builder Pattern. It has to be used to enumerate each *Effect* that is supposed to remain unhandled, before terminating the chain with `handle/handleWith` call. Otherwise, it's not supposed to typecheck.

Also, the type passed to `fx` has to be single *Effect*. Passing an *Effect Stack* of length other than `1`, won't work.


# Traversing

Traversing is transforming a collection-of-*Computations* into a *Computation*-of-collection.

Example:
```scala
// assuming:
val effs: List[Int !! Validation[String]] = ???

// let:
val eff = effs.parallelly // or:
val eff = effs.serially

// we get:
eff: List[Int] !! Validation[String]
```

By "collection", we mean `Option`, `Either` or any subclass of `Iterable`.  
Skutek defines extension methods for traversing them: 
* `parallelly` - Essentially, it's a fold with `*!`.  
  The parallelism is potential only. Whether it's exploited or not, deppends on *Handlers* used to run the resulting *Computation*.
* `serially` - Essentially, it's a **lazy** fold with `flatMap`.  
  By "lazyness" here, we mean that abortable *Effects* (e.g. `Maybe`, `Error` or `Validation`) may abort executing the whole computation on the first error/failure/etc. encountered in the sequence.

Obviously, for `Option` and `Either`, the difference between `serially` and `parallely` vanishes.
  
In case we want to traverse collection only for the *Effects*, and discard result of each element of the collection, there are more efficient alternatives:
* `parallellyVoid` 
* `seriallyVoid`

They are more efficient, because they avoid construction of useless collection of `()` values. Also, the result type of the *Computation* is overriden as `Unit`.

```scala
// assuming:
val effs: List[Int !! Validation[String]] = ???

// let:
val eff = effs.parallellyVoid // or:
val eff = effs.seriallyVoid

// we get:
eff: Unit !! Validation[String]
```

This part is the most likely to be modified in future versions of Skutek.
