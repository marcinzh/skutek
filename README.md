# Skutek: extensible effects without (heavy) lifting

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcinzh/skutek.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marcinzh/skutek)

Skutek ([pronounced](https://translate.google.com/#pl/en/skutek): *skoo-tech*) is a framework implementing a monad of extensible effects 
(a.k.a. [*One monad to rule them all*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGJLeHhsZBo)), based on [Freer monad](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf), adapted to leverage specifics of Scala's type system, with main differences being:

- Use of intersection types in lieu of union types (which Scala doesn't have), to model sets of effects.

- Use of classic OOP inheritence as the way of extending the monad with new operations.


# Example
```scala
import skutek._

object Main extends App {

  val eff = for {
    a <- Get[Int]
    b <- Ask[Int]
    c <- if (b != 0) Return(a / b) else Wrong(s"Tried to divide $a by zero")
    _ <- Put(c)
  } yield ()

  val handler = ErrorHandler[String] +! StateHandler(100).exec +! ReaderHandler(3)

  val result = handler.run(eff)

  println(result) // prints "Right(33)"
}
```

# Setup

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo

libraryDependencies += "com.github.marcinzh" %% "skutek-core" % "0.4.0"
```

# Features

- Simplicity of use:
    - No need of defining the effect stack upfront. 
    - No need of lifting of operations into the monad.
    - Effect subtyping.
    
- Simplicity of implementation:
    - No dependencies on external libraries.
    - No clever type-fu, no macros. Mostly immutable OOP style.
     
- Practical stuff:
    - Predefined set of basic effects (`Reader`, `Writer`, etc.).
    - Ability to annotate effects with tags
    - Potentially parallel execution of effects.
    - Support for `for` comprehension guards, for effects compatible with filtering (e.g. `Maybe`, `Choice`).
    - Tested stack safety.    
    
- Caveats and limitations:
    - General infancy of the project.
    - No possiblity of adapting pre-existing monads as Skutek's effects.
    - Removing effects from the stack (local handling) isn't as easy as adding them. Some explicit typing is necessary.
    - Rare occurences of false positives by Scala's linter (i.e. "inferred `Any`...")
    - Using patterns in `for` comprehensions can trigger surprising errors (Scala's wart, not specific to Skutek)
    - **Type unsafety:** Certain class of invalid effect stacks are detected **at runtime** only. 
    - Lack of performance analysis.
    - `Concurrency` effect is a hack.

# Core concepts in Skutek

1. **Effect**
1. **Effect Stack**
1. **Computation** (the monad)
1. **Operation**
1. **Handler**

# Effect

In Skutek, an *Effect* is an abstract **type**, serving as a unique, type-level name. Such type is never instantiated or extended. *Effects* are only useful as type-arguments for other types or methods. Most notably, for types of *Computations* and *Handler* constructors.

Effects can be:
* parameterless, e.g. `Maybe`, `Choice`
* or parametrized, e.g. `State[Int]`, `Error[String]`

# Effect Stack

TBD.

1. Type `Any` represents **empty** *Effect Stack*

1. Type `Any` is the neutral element of type intersection operator. In Scala, the following types are equivalent:
    ```scala
    State[Int]
    State[Int] with Any
    Any with State[Int]
    ```
    Therefore, they all represent the same *Effect Stack*.

1. The order of occurence of *Effects* in the *Effect Stack* doesn't matter. In Scala, the following types are equivalent:
    ```scala
    State[Int] with Maybe
    Maybe with State[Int]
    ```
    Therefore, they all represent the same *Effect stack*.

1. Multiple occurences of the same *Effect* in the *Effect Stack*, are equivalent to just one occurence. In Scala, the following types are equivalent:
    ```scala
    State[Int]
    State[Int] with State[Int]
    ```
    Therefore, they all represent the same *Effect Stack*.

1. Bigger *Effect Stack* is a subtype of a smaller *Effect Stack*. For example:
    ```scala
    State[Int] with Maybe <: State[Int]
    State[Int] with Maybe <: Maybe
    ```
    This will have consequences for types of *Computations* and *Handlers* (contravariance).

Redundancies and reorderings shown in points 2, 3 and 4, may appear in error messages, when the *Effect Stack* of a *Computation* is inferred by Scala's compiler. It's ugly, but normal.

A curious reader may wonder, what happens if there are two occurences of the same, parametrised *Effect* in the *Effect Stack*, but each one is applied with different type-argument. For example:
```scala
State[Int] with State[String]
```
It will be discussed it the section about **Tag Conflicts**.
